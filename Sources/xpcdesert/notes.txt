floats - 0x5000
    64 bit number following is little endian floating point

int64 - 0x3000
    64 bit signed number following

uint64 - 0x4000
    64 bit unsigned number following

bool - 0x2000
    32 bit follows (0 == false, else true)

array - 0xE000
    32 bit number of total bytes
    then 32 bit number of elements

array - 0xF000
    32 bit number of total bytes
    then 32 bit number of elements
    then a key string (nul term), align up to 4, then parse value

data - 0x8000
    32 bit number of total bytes
    then raw data bytes

string - 0x9000
    32 bit string length (including nul) follows
    then string data

uuid - 0xA000
    16 bytes follows

date - 0x7000
    64 bit number follows, unix time??

file - 0xB000
    not sure, doesn't seem to take any data after?
    some special thing, look at _xpc_fd_deserialize -> _xpc_graph_deserializer_read_port
